# Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Instagram User Interests Detection

## Description

With over one billion monthly active users and nearly 100 million photos shared daily, Instagram is a rich source of data for analyzing user interests and trends. However, compared to platforms like Facebook and Twitter, research on Instagram is limited, primarily due to the lack of publicly available labeled datasets. 

This project introduces an annotated multidomain dataset created from Instagram profiles and proposes an automatic approach for detecting and classifying user interests using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically BERT for text analysis and CNN for image analysis.

**Keywords**: Instagram, Neural Networks, Data Analysis, User Interests, BERT, CNN

## Problem Statement

The main challenges in classifying Instagram users' interests include:
- Gathering diverse and substantial data representing a wide range of interests.
- Ensuring all collected data is in English, as most Python NLP libraries do not support multilingual processing.

## Objectives

The project aims to:
1. Create an annotated multidomain dataset for training and testing.
2. Propose a method for automatic detection and classification of user interests using deep learning.
3. Leverage semantic and textual information (captions, hashtags, and visual content) to extract user interests.
4. Evaluate the proposed approaches using appropriate metrics to ensure effectiveness.

By addressing the challenges of limited research and datasets, this project contributes to the field by providing tools and methodologies to better understand and analyze Instagram user interests.
